- 👋 Hi, I’m @FrostedBrownie
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about online security, useful script writing, automating day to day tasks, and learning python more robustly.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, java, and anything else that peaks my interest.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I just don't know what it is I can do for these sorts of things. 
- 📫 How to reach me: frostedbrownie@pm.me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a huge obsession with random things, periodically. Today's obesession is Magic: The Gathering.
